# The Dodgeball App
----------------------------------
# Description:

This is a 2 player game where each person controls a square that can throw balls at the other player, and you must dodge balls thrown at you by your opponent. We are making it for our APCSP class and for the AP test.

# Installation:

No installation is required except for a web browser.
----------------------------------
# Usage:

Blue is controlled using the WASD keys and throws using Caps Lock. Red is controlled using the 4 arrow keys and throws with the Enter Key. 
Pick up a stationary ball on your wall by hovering over it. Throw at your opponent. Throws will have a little randomness. You get a point when your opponent is hit. 
The balls start out slow and progressively get faster. Space starts a new round after someone wins.
