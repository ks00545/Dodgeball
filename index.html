            Blue is controlled using the WASD keys and throws using Caps Lock. Red is controlled using the 4 arrow keys and throws with the Enter Key. 
            Pick up a stationary ball on your wall by hovering over it. Throw at your opponent. Throws will have a little randomness. You get a point when your opponent is hit. 
            The balls start out slow and progressively get faster. Space starts a new round after someone wins.
